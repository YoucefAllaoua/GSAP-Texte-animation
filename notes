// 2- by default the animation are adde in the end of the timeline
// 3-if we want to set the time when an animation will start we can use tines in second
// tl.fromTo("target" , {from} , {to} , timeToStartTheAnimation after the timeline start animation after the timeline start)
// "<" The start of previous animation**. Think of < as a pointer back to the start of the previous animation.
// ">" - The end of the previous animation**. Think of > as a pointer to the end of the previous animation
// "+=1" - 1 second past the end of the timeline (creates a gap)
// "-=1" - 1 second before the end of the timeline (overlaps)
